	  Library for computing Fast Fourier Transforms.

	  This library computes Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) in one
	  or more dimensions. It is extremely fast. This package
	  contains the shared library version of the fftw libraries in
	  single precision.

	bool "optimise for speed over accuracy"
	help
	  Optimise for fast math functions, at the expense of accuracy.

	  Say 'y' if you need speed and can live with inaccuracies in
	  the results. Say 'n' (the default) if accuracy is of utmost
	  importance.

	  This basically uses gcc's -Ofast optimisation level, which in
	  turn is basically using gcc's -ffast-math. See the gcc manual
	  for what this means.
